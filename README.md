# Homework

This is a simple website created as part of a homework assignment for my college. Please note that the website is **not designed for navigation** across different devices. Currently, it is built exclusively for desktop view, and **mobile responsiveness is not implemented**. Therefore, the website is intended to be viewed **only on a PC**. And the project is not yet completed. This is just a template for the actual webpage and major design changes will also be implemented.

If you're viewing this on any other device, you may experience poor layout.
